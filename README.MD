# WebAux

This allows anyone on your local network to play songs just by making a quick search on a simple web page. It beats constantly switching cables, phones, connecting to Bluetooth, etc... TCP/IP just works it seems. 

## How To  

Run the Flask server on the computer that is plugged into the sound system. Pull up the web page in any browser on the local network by typing in the address and port number of the server machine and flask server port. Then search a song and listen to it play.
